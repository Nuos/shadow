Execution
	Probably just use a separate thread for execution, which runs at a fixed framerate
Graphics
	Thread running at lower priority than execution, at a non-fixed framerate (but possibly with a framerate cap?)
Shadowing
	Thread producing triangles onto a stack to be consumed (drawn) by the graphics thread
