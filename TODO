- Set up separate thread for execution (input handling and entity control), running at a fixed framerate
- Fix shadow calculation
- Write code to support rendering to a texture and then blitting the texture to the screen
- Write code to support sprite sheets
- Write map editor
- Write text drawing code
    - Probably the easiest way is to make a spritemap image containing all the characters, and use OpenGL to get particular characters from the image
    - For the above reason (and also to facilitate easily finding the width of a string), only monospace fonts will be supported
