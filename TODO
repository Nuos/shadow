Engine:
    Set up separate thread for execution (player and entity control), running at a fixed framerate

Shadow:
    Render shadow mask to a framebuffer
    Blit the framebuffer over the map using a fragment shader
    Possibly apply effects when blending the framebuffer (such as detecting the edge of a dark area and making it less dark)
    In the fragment shader also apply a darkening effect depending on distance from player (so far away stuff is darker / harder to see)

Map:
    Write a map editor
    Come up with a way to automatically generate maps
        Kind of like dungeon generation in e.g. Minecraft
        Define structures as a series of walls defined by lines defined by points - should be easy to rotate and scale them and change texture
        Generate larger structures (rooms) by combining variations of smaller structures
        
    Implement textured map tiles (using the polygon idea - a polygon is a group of line-segments which will be filled in with a texture

Entities:
    Write an entity system
    Only render if the player can see them
    Possibly do shadows for entities (technically possible, idk how to draw them though)
    Implement animated sprite sheets
